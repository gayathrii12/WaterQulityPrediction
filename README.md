# Water Quality Prediction

A project focused on predicting water quality using data analysis and machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates the implementation of models to classify or predict water quality based on various parameters.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classification or regression models for prediction.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data insights and model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive design for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation.

## How It Works

1. Data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis.
2. Machine learning models are trained on historical data to predict water quality.
3. Results are displayed with insights and visualizations.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gayathrii12/WaterQulityPrediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WaterQulityPrediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
